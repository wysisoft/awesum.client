      What is the Awesum app? 
  </h2>
  <p>awesum app is a tool for kids that reinforces spelling and math with rewards. Teachers and parents can assign a kid assignments. Parents can monitor the completion of the assignments. It is a website located at https://awesum.app that can also run as an app installed from the app store.</p>
  <h2>
      Who am I?
  </h2>
  <p>I am a guy from Denver, CO USA with kids. I felt an app like this needed to exist.</p>
  <h2>
      Is my data safe?
  </h2>
  <p>The app runs on a server in Amazon AWS and is patched regularly. No one but me has access to user data. I don't look at user data, except as narrowly as possible during technical troubleshooting. I do not store extremely sensitive data about my family on the app because that is bad use of the internet. I recommend you do not either.</p>
